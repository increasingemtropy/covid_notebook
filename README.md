R notebook for novel coronavirus data

This R notebook imports coronavrius data from John Hopkins University and plots the data since ~March until the current day.

The plot only features a subset of countries, and plots the cumulative cases over 14 days per 10k population. 
This allows us to make rough comparisons between differnt countries.

Still TO DO:
 - Move the plotting options somewhere so that the user can more easily customise the plot
 - Do some data manipulation to be able to plot cumulative deaths over 14 days per 10k population
